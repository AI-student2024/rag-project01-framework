Operational goals shown are absolute targets and not indexed to production levels or growth. 2022 performance was affected by changes associated with occupancy and operations during the COVID-19 \npandemic, as well as conservation and changes in how Boeing purchases energy. The targets were established against a 2017 base year. The 2025 goals will act as a milestone to guide actions and  \nprogress to the 2030 goals.\n2.  All 2025 reduction goals were set with an operational boundary of the Core Metric Sites, which represent the majority (70%) of Boeing\u2019s operations, and includes emissions from electricity use and natural gas.\n3.  The 2030 reduction goals set with an operational boundary of The Boeing Company and includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n4.  The net-zero achievement covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for all manufacturing and work sites within the company\u2019s operational control as well as Scope 3, business travel. This is achieved  \nby expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n5. Energy includes natural gas, other fuels and electricity.\n6. Water data represents approximately 84% of operations square footage.\n7.  Solid waste numbers represent values determined from scale-weighed containers as well as calculated weights. Nonhazardous solid waste is sent to landfill for disposal. This measure applies to all waste \nstreams where Boeing is responsible for waste disposal service as a normal part of daily operations (excludes remediation and construction-related waste).\n8.  Hazardous waste is determined from U.S. EPA hazardous manifest or equivalent government shipping documents. All types of hazardous wastes that are generated at a facility and are discarded from  \nthe site for disposal, and would be considered part of the environmental footprint of the site.

      "text_10": "Parts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from  \nthe movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional \nhubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can \nlessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 \nfor more information.\nSupplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral \nframework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. \nUsed Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material.\u00a0\nBuild/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other \nwork sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product. Boeing cuts waste to landfill, water, energy and hazardous chemicals.  \nRead more about how we do so on Page 52. For example, when testing aircraft, Boeing uses blended sustainable aviation fuels. \nSustainable Operations: Since 2020, Boeing has maintained workplace net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1  \nand Scope 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected,  \nthird-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.\necoDemonstrator: To accelerate innovation for current and future airplane sustainability, our 10-year-old ecoDemonstrator flying test bed program takes \npromising technologies out of a lab and tests them in an operational environment.\nUse. Boeing provides solutions for customers to lower their carbon footprints while they are using our aircraft. For example, armed with real-time data, flight \ncrews can make adjustments to optimize fuel use, and thus minimize the carbon footprint of each flight. Digital tools empower our airline customers to conserve \nfuel, track emissions and enhance their operations\u2019 overall efficiency, while defense customers can conserve fuel and lower emissions with platform-agnostic \ndigital systems with maintenance, supply chain and flight planning recommendations based on\u00a0analytics.\nGovernment Services: As our tools ingest flight, maintenance and supply data, our analytics produce results that drive efficiency across the system. \nRead more on Page 37.\nEnd of Service. Up to 90 percent of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries. We manage \nand recertify used parts for aircraft, and engine platforms for our customers. \nRemanufactured: Boeing remanufactures aircraft, such as the 115 AH-64D Apache for government customers, which includes upgrading configurations with the \nlatest technology and keeping valuable materials in a closed loop.\u00a0\nBoeing Converted Freighter Fleet Renewal: Boeing\u2019s passenger-to-freighter programs provide airlines an economical way to replace less efficient,  \nolder-generation freighters with more efficient freighters created from repurposed passenger aircraft.\u00a0\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nGlobal Aerospace Safety\nSustainable Product  \nLife Cycle\nInnovation and  \nClean Technology\nFleet Renewal\nOperational Efficiency\nRenewable Energy\nAdvanced Technology\nPartnerships \nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n32",

Waste streams are as \ncomplex as our facilities, which range from office space to part fabrication to \nassembly of aircraft and space vehicles. Solid waste includes material that has \nbeen discarded or abandoned or that is no longer useful or usable and has been \ndesignated for removal. Items that are reused or reclaimed are excluded from \nsolid waste. Boeing has dedicated teams working to prevent waste from going \nto landfills and to assess opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts. \nBoeing generates hazardous waste primarily from a variety of research, \nmanufacturing and facilities maintenance processes.\u00a0Hazardous waste may \nbe recycled upstream or downstream, as on-site or off-site reclamation and \navoided generation through processes that extend useful life of consumable \nchemicals to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste \nin upstream activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous \nwaste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. \nDownstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations.  \nWe implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need  \nfor new chemicals.\nProgress Toward 2025 Hazardous and Nonhazardous  \nWaste Goals\n\u2022 Solid Waste \u2013 40% reduction compared to 2017. The continued trend of \nincreased remote working conditions influences the overall reduction in \nsolid waste. Conservation initiatives and vendor management continue to be \nopportunities to drive further reductions. \n\u2022 Hazardous Waste \u2013 9% reduction compared to 2017. Hazardous waste \nwas 1% higher than anticipated during the year.

We reduce carbon emissions from  \nthe movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional \nhubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can \nlessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 \nfor more information.\nSupplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral \nframework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. \nUsed Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material.\u00a0\nBuild/Test.
