Aviation is integral to our modern world, touching many sectors of \nthe global economy and enabling personal human connections. That’s why \nwe title our report “Sustainable Aerospace Together.” Each of us has a role  \nto play to ensure we make the world better for future generations. \nIn this report, you’ll see examples of our collective efforts and partnerships to \nadvance environmental stewardship, human development and inclusion — \nunderpinned by transparency at every level as we strive to make aerospace \nmore sustainable, together. \nWorking Together for the Environment\nCollaboration with global industry partners, the energy sector, governments, \nnongovernmental organizations, higher education institutions and other \nstakeholders to advance sustainable solutions is more necessary than ever. \nTo increase education around the commercial aviation industry’s carbon \nfootprint, and its ambition to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, \nBoeing created an innovative visual data modeling tool known as Cascade, \nwhich you will learn more about in this report. Cascade models the climate \nimpact of the commercial aviation industry and explores paths to decarbonize \nand reach net zero by 2050.\nWithin our manufacturing operations, it is not just what we build, but how \nwe build our products. We increasingly look at every stage of the product \nlife cycle through a sustainability lens. Our people have worked hard to \nreduce our environmental impact by investing in conservation and procuring  \nmore renewable electricity. \n... continued on next page\nDave Calhoun, President and CEO\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction \nPresident and CEO Message\nCSO Message\n2022 Highlights\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n3",

      "content": "CSO Message\nMapping the Sustainable Aerospace Future Together \nDecarbonizing aerospace is both the challenge and opportunity\nof our lifetime. We have long maintained that decarbonizing \naerospace will take everything — technology, policy, capital, \nenergy, entrepreneurship — and everyone — employees, \ncustomers, financiers, regulators, academics and business \npartners. For that reason, we just convened global thought \nleaders and decision-makers from across these communities \nto review our progress to date and discuss the way forward \ntoward achieving Sustainable Aerospace Together.\nAerospace is more than an industry. We connect people \naround the globe and promote an understanding of  \ndifferent cultures; we protect through national security and \nhumanitarian relief; we contribute to the global economy with \njobs, trade, technology and commerce; and we inspire young \nminds to seek careers in STEM. Commercial aviation also \ngenerates about 2.5% of the world’s carbon emissions and \n12% of transport emissions, so we must find ways to further \ndecouple forecasted growth of aerospace from greenhouse \ngas emissions (GHG) … and continue to do so safely  \nand transparently.\nThe engagement was energizing and encouraging as sector \nleaders leaned into the issues and potential roadblocks \nthat could slow the commercial aviation industry’s progress \ntoward meeting its net-zero 2050 ambition. What struck me \nwas the collective decision in tackling this issue together \nfor the greater good of the industry and humanity at large. \nIt was also a reminder that this hard to abate industry has \nhistorically solved hard challenges — from inventing flight  \nto discovering the universe. It’s with humility and resolve  \nthat we collectively take on the challenge of more  \nsustainable aerospace.\nDuring the event, we also launched a public version of \nCascade, a web-based application that uses public aviation \nand energy data to visualize how various approaches might \nbe combined to lower emissions. It was rewarding to see \nour partners and stakeholders engage with the tool, and we \ncan’t wait for the global user community to further refine \nCascade over time. We invite everyone to check it out at \nSustainabilityTogether.aero. \nThis Sustainable Aerospace Together Forum was a \nculmination of many activities and events that took place \nthroughout 2022 with the same common theme — together. \nWe made important progress over the past year with valued \npartners around the globe. \nTogether … \nWe launched Cascade. At the Farnborough International \nAirshow in July 2022, we announced Cascade and provided \na live demonstration of Version 1.0. Cascade was developed \nto visualize the climate impact of aviation across the world \nand explore scenarios to most effectively decarbonize \ncommercial aviation by 2050: fleet renewal, operational \nefficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and new aviation \ntechnologies such as transonic truss-braced wing structures, \nhybrid-electric, all-electric or hydrogen airplanes. This tool \nallows stakeholders across the industry — in particular \ncustomers and policymakers — to make informed decisions \nand trade-offs about how to best reach the commercial \naviation industry’s net-zero 2050 ambition. We look forward \nto the additional feedback from the recent public launch and \nwill continue to invest in Cascade through collaborating with \nfounding members of the Community to include IATA, NASA, \nUniversity of Cambridge’s Whittle Laboratory and the MIT \nLaboratory for Aviation and the Environment.\nChris Raymond, Chief Sustainability Officer\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction \nPresident and CEO Message\nCSO Message\n2022 Highlights\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n5",

      "content": "We advanced SAF. Nearly all industry and governmental \ndecarbonization road maps conclude that SAF is the biggest \nlever we have to reduce GHG emissions from commercial \naviation. Our company is focused on multiple areas to \ncatalyze SAF scaling, including investing in airplane efficiency \nand compatibility, purchasing SAF for our own fuel use in \nour operations, engaging global regulators on smart policies, \npromoting robust sustainability criteria, and investing  \nin Cascade to further industry partnerships and policy \nadvocacy to scale up SAF supply and bring down cost. \nWe continue to make progress on the technical journey \nworking with our suppliers to ensure our commercial \nairplanes are 100% SAF compatible by 2030. We are \nseeing exciting SAF innovation occurring in sustainable \nfeedstocks and partnering on technologies including waste-\nand-biomass-based SAF, power-and-biomass-to-liquid and \npower-to-liquid enablers that can make existing and future \nSAF pathways more sustainable over time. \nWe purchased 5.6 million gallons (21.2 million liters) of \nblended SAF to support our commercial operations. The \nchallenge remains scaling SAF availability and lowering its \ncost. Together, we’ve made important progress this year \non building the industry. Governments around the world \nare unlocking policy mechanisms to scale SAF, including a \nblending mandate and corresponding offtake requirement in \nEurope, and incentives such as the Blenders Tax Credit for \nSAF producers in the U.S. These policies and incentives are \nbeginning to attract necessary capital to scale production. \nFinally, the Boeing ecoDemonstrator team partnered  \nwith NASA on emissions testing to better understand SAF  \nand contrails.\nWe advanced the future of flight. While SAF is a \nnecessary lever to decarbonize commercial aviation,  \nwe have a “SAF and” view and not a “SAF or” approach \nto achieving the commercial aviation industry’s net zero goal \nby 2050. Together with partners, we continue to explore the \nsafety and viability of other renewable energy carriers and \ntechnologies for aircraft. You’ll read about several of these \ndevelopments in this report, including our Wisk joint venture’s \nannouncement of the world’s first self-flying, all-electric \nfour-passenger vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air  \ntaxi. As Wisk’s go-to-market aircraft, the latest generation  \nof this aircraft represents the first-ever candidate for type \ncertification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration  \nof an autonomous eVTOL. We also value our partnerships \naround the world to advance sustainable technologies,  \nsuch as the new Boeing Research and Technology  \ncenter in Japan with a focus on sustainability. We are also \nhonored to be selected by NASA for the Sustainable Flight \nDemonstrator program, which will inform future designs  \nthat could lead to breakthrough aerodynamics and future \nefficiency gains.\nThe aforementioned Boeing ecoDemonstrator program \nembodies our “together” theme and is celebrating its \n10-year anniversary this year. The ecoDemonstrator \ntakes promising technologies out of a lab and tests them \nin operational environments with a variety of partners, \nincluding airline customers, suppliers and regulatory \nagencies. From the first ecoDemonstrator in 2012 through \nthis year’s effort, the ecoDemonstrator program will have \nevaluated more than 225 technologies with approximately \none-third of those getting implemented. Projects include \ntechnologies that reduce fuel use, emissions and noise, \nenhance safety and incorporate more sustainable materials. \nSustainable Aerospace starts within our four walls and \nBoeing continues to make progress on our 2025 operational \ntargets as outlined on Page 53. \nSee Page 7 for a more comprehensive snapshot of our \naccomplishments last year and Page 45 for an overview of \nhow we partnered around the globe to advance sustainable \naerospace together. \nTogether as an industry, we’ve made modern jet travel a \nreality, helped defend freedom around the world, and made \nspace exploration possible. We now enter the era of more \nsustainable aerospace. The foundation we are laying now  \nwill be carried forward by future generations to preserve  \nand grow the societal benefits of this industry. We are proud \nto be on this journey — together — with so many capable \nand committed partners around the globe. \nChris Raymond \nChief Sustainability Officer\nNeil Titchener, Ellen Ebner and Chris Raymond unveil the public \nversion of Cascade during the Sustainable Aerospace Together \nForum in Renton.

For example, Innovation and Clean Tech  \nis a key priority for Boeing and our 2030 goal of 100% \nSAF-compatible current and future commercial airplanes  \nis a key component to the commercial aviation industry’s \nclimate goals. Within the ERM process, Boeing mitigates \nand manages the key strategic risk to this priority and  \ngoal — the ability to scale SAF supply to meet the demand \nneeded to achieve the commercial aviation industry’s \nnet-zero ambitions. SAF as a drop in fuel is currently \napproved to be blended at 50/50 blend with Jet A and \nworks with existing airplanes and offers the largest \npotential to reduce carbon emissions over the next 20  \nto 30 years in all aviation segments. Boeing’s intent is  \nto help catalyze SAF scaling through subject matter \nexpertise, investments in product compatibility work, \npurchasing SAF for our own fuel use, and our partnerships \nand policy advocacy. As mentioned on Page 45, Boeing \ncontinued to make key investments to scale SAF in 2022.\nWithin the sections of this report, we will continue to discuss \nour governance, risk identification and management of our \nkey priorities. \nBusiness Continuity Management\nBoeing strengthens its resiliency through Business \nContinuity Management (BCM), managing and mitigating \nrisks should a significant incident disrupt business \noperations. This entails five key preparedness programs: \nBusiness, Emergency, Information Technology, Supply \nChain and Human Resources, working together to \nfacilitate company resiliency.

Boeing offers an EAP to provide support to employees \nand eligible family members navigating difficult life events. \nA few examples of how the EAP  \nhelped employees:\n• Conflict Zones: In addition to providing emotional support \nto leaders, managers and employees during the war in \nUkraine, the EAP offered local employees and their families \nhelp with locating emergency resources and information. In \nMarch, Boeing extended EAP services to European-based \nsubsidiaries and contract workers to help them cope with \nthe crisis.\n• Pandemic Relief: To assist employees in China \nimpacted by strict COVID-19-related travel restrictions \nand lockdowns, EAP provided virtual group support for \nemployee work groups in both Mandarin and English. \n• Trauma Care: Following the Robb Elementary School \nshooting in Uvalde, Texas, in May and the Highland Park \nshooting near Chicago in July, counselors were available to \nsupport employees and provide information about the EAP.\n• Natural Disasters: The EAP prepared resources to support \nmultiple natural disasters occurring in the U.S., including \nemployees affected by Hurricane Ian in September.\n• Stress Relief: To relieve stress and promote emotional \nwell-being, the EAP conducted 597 Mindfulness Meditation \nsessions with more than 3,100 participants.\n• Suicide Prevention: EAP coordinated with the Boeing \nVeteran Engagement Team (BVET) employee resource group \nto offer suicide prevention webinars to their membership.\n• Mental Health Screenings: All employees were \nencouraged to complete online anxiety and depression \nscreenings to help assess their risks and learn about \ngetting help if they needed it. \nOur final thought: The Boeing EAP provides support \nto employees and eligible family members at no cost. \nProfessional EAP counselors can provide help with navigating \nlife events, stress management, work-life challenges, grief \nand loss, substance abuse and more.\nAndrea Landsman, manager, Boeing EAP\n“ The Boeing EAP was available \n24/7 worldwide to provide \ncounseling and other resources  \nfor our employees, some of  \nwhom were faced with very \nchallenging circumstances.”\nAndrea Landsman, manager, Boeing EAP\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nWorkplace Safety\nEmployee Well-Being\nGlobal Equity, Diversity \nand Inclusion \nProfessional Development, \nEducation and Learning\nProducts & Services\nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n23",

The report is an invitation to all \nprospective and current employees, suppliers, customers \nand community partners to join us on our journey toward \nbecoming a more equitable and inclusive company. \nBoeing has roughly 156,000 employees representing 47 \nnationalities in 65 countries. In 2022 we hired more than \n23,000 new teammates, resulting in an increase in female \nrepresentation across virtually all job levels — production \nand maintenance, individual contributors, managers, \ndirectors and executives — and increased racial and ethnic \nrepresentation in the U.S. at junior and senior levels. We also \nsaw increased rates of participation in our self-identification \nprocess, which encourages employees to confidentially share \ntheir disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity and \nveteran status. \nKey Highlights Included:\nIn 2022, Boeing tied inclusive hiring processes to its incentive \ncompensation: 92% of candidate interview slates in 2022 for \nmanager or director-level roles included at least one woman \nglobally, or at least one woman or racial/ethnic minority in \nthe U.S., showing that specific, measurable and financially \nrelevant accountability has an affect on incentivizing the right \nbehaviors that naturally lead to more diverse outcomes.\nWe reformed our Racial Equity Steering Team (newly named \nEquity & Inclusion Council) to include Executive Council \nchampions and representatives from each of our nine Business \nResource Groups, which increased transparency and access  \nto senior leadership. We also made progress on our six \nspecific 2025 aspirations we announced and continue to \nreport against.\nAs we look forward to 2023 and beyond, we are energized  \nby the progress we’ve made and are committed to continuing \nthe hard work because it is necessary not just for our \nbusiness success but also for the sustainability of aerospace \nand our communities. \nPay equity summary\nWe foster a diverse, collaborative and inclusive environment \nthat empowers employees to do their best. Equal pay for \nequal work is a foundational element of our approach. We \nhold ourselves accountable to equal pay for equal work by \nconducting regular compensation reviews to ensure that \nemployees are compensated equitably throughout their \ncareers — independent of race, gender or ethnicity. It’s the \nright thing to do and makes us a better, more inclusive and \nhigher-performing company. We’re committed to continuing \nand expanding our analysis globally and doing the work to \nensure pay equity at the time of hire and throughout every \nemployee’s career.\nSamuel Atilabachew, Commercial Airplanes, Renton.

We take seriously the \nresponsibility to ensure those who operate, fly on and  \nservice our products are safe. \nOur Board of Directors oversees global aerospace safety \nthrough a dedicated subcommittee of the board, the \nAerospace Safety Committee, to which our chief aerospace \nsafety officer provides regular updates. More information \nabout the subcommittee’s oversight can be found in our \nChief Aerospace Safety Officer Report.\nIn 2020, Boeing began implementing its enterprise Safety \nManagement System, or SMS. As an integrated framework \nfor managing safety risks throughout the product and service \nlife cycle, SMS incorporates data from employee reporting, \nproduction, compliance, quality and safety processes. This \nprovides line of sight to risks, incidents and identified hazards \nto enable proactive mitigation of issues and to continuously \nimprove safety performance. Ultimately, SMS brings the  \nright data into the right forums with the right people to  \nmake data-driven, risk-based decisions that result in safer \nproducts. It is a journey of continuous improvement informed \nby existing data and ongoing development of increasingly \nbetter safety analytics.\nLearn more about our progress in the Chief Aerospace \nSafety Officer Report.\nBoeing’s safety journey: \nEvery step is purposeful\nThe big picture: The safety of our products \nstarts with our culture and is supported by \ntechnology and training. Advancements in both \nareas have led to progress in our safety journey. \nWhy culture is first: When more teammates \nfeel comfortable speaking up about safety issues \nand ideas — and more leaders listen — we will \nhave safer products. Our Speak Up program \nis the fuel for our enterprise SMS that helps \nmanage safety risks throughout the product and \nservices life cycle. Through efforts in the past year: \n• Submissions to our Speak Up reporting  \nchannel doubled from 2021 to 2022 — a sign  \nof progress toward a healthy reporting culture. \n• We trained more than 130,000 of our \nteammates on SMS, safety culture and why  \nit matters.\n• We established a dedicated ombudsperson for \nFAA Organization Designation Authorization \nrepresentatives to support their independence \nand transparency (see Page 29).\nHow technology and training help: \nAlongside culture improvements, advancements  \nin technology are helping us identify safety \nhazards and risks through data, and are helping \ncustomers. Last year, we: \n• Introduced the Boeing Virtual Procedures \nTrainer and Maintenance Synthetic Trainer for \npilots and mechanics to provide experiential \ntraining and complement current training.\n• Inducted a new real-time data and analytics platform \ncalled Boeing Safety Intelligence into our SMS. \n• Delivered competency-based training and assessment \n(CBTA) courses to four commercial customers. \nAdditionally, Boeing Next-Generation 737, 737 MAX  \nand 787 CBTA courses were approved by multiple \nregulatory agencies.\nWhy it matters: “Over the next few years, we’re going \nto see the maturity of our SMS, increased collaboration \nwith our customers to get ahead of safety risks and \ndeployment of our Safety Experience tool for increasing \ntransparency and learning throughout the organization,” \nsaid Mike Delaney, Boeing chief aerospace safety officer. \n“Every step is purposeful to make our products safer. \nThese efforts and more have laid both the cultural and \nstructural foundation for our safety journey. It’s up to us \nto keep that foundation strong and build on it.”\nRead more about our safety journey in the Boeing \nChief Aerospace Safety Officer Report, including \nhow we’re working with industry to strengthen \naviation safety and created a new Safety Experience \nwebsite — a resource intended for employees to \nbetter understand their role in Boeing’s safety culture.\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nGlobal Aerospace Safety\nSustainable Product  \nLife Cycle\nInnovation and  \nClean Technology\nFleet Renewal\nOperational Efficiency\nRenewable Energy\nAdvanced Technology\nPartnerships \nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n28",

      "content": "Sustainable Product Life Cycle\nBoeing increasingly looks at every stage of the \nproduct life cycle through a sustainability lens \nWe continue to evolve our approach so that our next generation of products consider \nthe full breadth of sustainability including environmental, health, safety and human \nfactors improvements by targeting the following seven areas: \nDemand/Sales. Customers continue to demand higher-\nefficiency, lower emissions products. Globally, airlines and \ngovernments are increasingly accountable to emerging sustainability \nstandards, which requires that they evaluate the life cycle of aircraft they \noperate. \nCascade: Boeing’s data modeling and visualization tool quantifies the potential of four strategies to cut \nemissions, including fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy and future aircraft introduction. \nDesign/Technology. Boeing evaluates new product designs and technologies to determine if they are safe \nand sustainable by conducting an environmental life cycle assessment. We strive to evaluate new aircraft \ndesign concepts, materials and technologies early in the development process to assess how much we can \nreduce the risks and expenses associated with its environmental footprint. We aim to examine whether more \nsustainable approaches exist for new product design, considering everything from selecting materials and \nparts to improving manufacturing processes and in-service operations to recycling the plane.\nSAF-Compatible Commercial Airplanes: Boeing is collaborating with suppliers to achieve our goal that  \nall commercial airplanes we deliver by 2030 will be compatible with SAF. \nMaterials/Feedstocks. Boeing examines coatings that improve our planes’ aerodynamics, fuel efficiency \nand longevity, in part by using more parts that can be repurposed. Lighter composite materials permit us to \ndesign more fuel-efficient aircraft like our primarily composite 787 Dreamliner. Boeing simultaneously supports \nresearch into regenerative feedstocks that can replace constituents that are nonrenewable resources. For \nexample, the bio-based regenerative feedstocks from forestry waste and pine root oil that we are researching  \nat Villanova University may one day be integrated into the epoxy resins used in our interior parts, enabling us  \nto reduce the feedstock-related emissions from extraction and refining compared to petrochemical-based \nfeedstocks. Meantime, we recycle the metals used in manufacturing our aircraft back into our supply chain,\nreducing reliance on virgin materials.\nSUSTAINABLE\nPRODUCT \nLIFE CYCLE\nEnd of\nService\nDemand/\nSales\nDesign/\nTechnology\nMaterials/\nFeedstocks\nParts\nBuild/Test\nUse\n“ Across Boeing Defense, Space  \n& Security, we believe that \noperational effectiveness and \nsustainability are two sides of the \nsame coin.

      "content": "Parts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from  \nthe movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional \nhubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can \nlessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 \nfor more information.\nSupplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral \nframework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. \nUsed Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material. \nBuild/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other \nwork sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product. Boeing cuts waste to landfill, water, energy and hazardous chemicals.  \nRead more about how we do so on Page 52. For example, when testing aircraft, Boeing uses blended sustainable aviation fuels. \nSustainable Operations: Since 2020, Boeing has maintained workplace net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1  \nand Scope 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected,  \nthird-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.\necoDemonstrator: To accelerate innovation for current and future airplane sustainability, our 10-year-old ecoDemonstrator flying test bed program takes \npromising technologies out of a lab and tests them in an operational environment.\nUse. Boeing provides solutions for customers to lower their carbon footprints while they are using our aircraft. For example, armed with real-time data, flight \ncrews can make adjustments to optimize fuel use, and thus minimize the carbon footprint of each flight. Digital tools empower our airline customers to conserve \nfuel, track emissions and enhance their operations’ overall efficiency, while defense customers can conserve fuel and lower emissions with platform-agnostic \ndigital systems with maintenance, supply chain and flight planning recommendations based on analytics.\nGovernment Services: As our tools ingest flight, maintenance and supply data, our analytics produce results that drive efficiency across the system. \nRead more on Page 37.\nEnd of Service. Up to 90 percent of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries. We manage \nand recertify used parts for aircraft, and engine platforms for our customers. \nRemanufactured: Boeing remanufactures aircraft, such as the 115 AH-64D Apache for government customers, which includes upgrading configurations with the \nlatest technology and keeping valuable materials in a closed loop. \nBoeing Converted Freighter Fleet Renewal: Boeing’s passenger-to-freighter programs provide airlines an economical way to replace less efficient,  \nolder-generation freighters with more efficient freighters created from repurposed passenger aircraft. \n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nGlobal Aerospace Safety\nSustainable Product  \nLife Cycle\nInnovation and  \nClean Technology\nFleet Renewal\nOperational Efficiency\nRenewable Energy\nAdvanced Technology\nPartnerships \nOperations\nCommunities\nReporting\n32",

For our products, \nrenewable energy can help \nreduce the carbon intensity \nof an energy powering \nour products, such as \nSustainable Aviation Fuel \n(SAF), green hydrogen and \nbatteries. Boeing believes \nSAF is a necessary lever \nto decarbonize aviation. \nHowever, it will take a \n“SAF and” approach and \nnot a “SAF or” approach \nto support the commercial \naviation industry’s \nambition for net zero by \n2050. As part of the “SAF \nand” approach, Boeing \ncontinues to advance the \nviability of other renewable \nenergy carriers and their \nsafe use on aircraft.\nFor additional information \non SAF, please reference \nthe SAF Fact Sheet.\nCreating a decarbonized \nsolution in the UAE\nWhen Boeing was invited to analyze a \nstudy that looked at developing SAF in the \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), the decision \nto participate was easy and will support the \ngrowth of SAF production in the region.\nThe “Power-to-Liquids Roadmap” report \nexamines the financial, economic and \nenvironmental benefits of decarbonizing the \ncountry’s aviation industry with an emerging \nSAF technology.\nBoeing’s role: The report was developed by \nthe UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure \nin collaboration with the World Economic \nForum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Initiative. \nBoeing participated by offering expertise at the \nlaunch event, analyzing the findings and being \nan active member of the UAE’s SAF task force, \nwhich is led by the Ministry of Energy and \nInfrastructure and provides strategic guidance \non a range of fuel options, including Power-to-\nLiquids (PtL), a type of SAF.\nWhat is PtL? SAF requires careful attention \nto detail. There are several pathways to \ncreating PtL (Power-to-Liquid) including the \nprocess where renewable electricity, CO2 and \nwater are synthesized into a liquid hydrocarbon, \nincluding jet fuel.\nHere’s how it’s made:\n•  Electricity is applied to the water (H2O).  \nThe hydrogen is collected and the oxygen  \nis set aside.\n•  The hydrogen is mixed with the carbon \ndioxide in a reactor until it matures. \n•  The liquid is removed from the reactor, \nwhich results in PtL jet fuel. \nResources needed: This PtL relies on \ntwo things in the UAE: tapping into the UAE’s \nabundant sources of renewable energy \n(intense sunshine and sustained winds), as \nwell as its ability to capture carbon dioxide \nfrom the air or from point sources such as \nindustrial waste gases.\nPtL is considered a significant technology  \nfor the UAE to decarbonize aviation. Other \ncountries are also studying PtL to mature the \ntechnology and assess how this pathway may \nhelp them decarbonize.\nThe upshot: The UAE report shows that it \nwould be ambitious but feasible for the country \nto produce as much as 11 million tons of PtL \nSAF by 2050 — equivalent to approximately \n70% of national jet fuel consumption.\nIt’s all about partnerships: “We \ncollaborate with policymakers across six \ncontinents to support the SAF value chain, \nincluding its supply, use, certification and life \ncycle,” said Mohammed Al Ghailani, Boeing’s \nsustainability lead for the Middle East and \nAfrica. “We were thrilled to support the UAE’s \nongoing research into developing a renewable \nfuel that would be suitable to the region.”\nThe Emirates flight test utilized 18 tons of SAF in one engine of a 777-300ER blended from two producers, \nNeste and Virent. The flight flew over the Dubai coastline for just over an hour.

      "content": "Digital factory of the future\nBoeing is utilizing an industry-leading technology to transform \nthe way we design, test and build airplanes. Today, Boeing \nengineering teams are studying how recent lessons learned \nfrom across the company could shape the factory of the \nfuture — with digital transformation as a major driver.\nWhy it matters: Stability and optimized performance  \nis happening. \n• Boeing’s T-7A Red Hawk team was able to build the first \nseveral aircraft in simulations before production even \nstarted and then join the aft and forward fuselages in less \nthan a half-hour, a process that would normally take days. \n• Although commercial airplanes are larger and production \nrequirements are different from military aircraft, Boeing \nteams will apply those learnings to future programs. \nThat knowledge, combined with more than a century of \ndevelopment experience on other programs, will guide \nfuture production.\nIt comes down to this: This will enable Boeing to predict \nperformance of the production system and see how changes \nin the airplane design affect that performance, or vice versa. \nIt will also allow teams to “build” the first several aircraft in a \nsimulation, flattening the learning curve. Supplier readiness \nand success around first-time quality enables Boeing to \noperate more sustainably as a business. \nBy driving quality within the supply chain, Boeing demonstrates \nits commitment to sustainability by reducing rework and/or \ndelayed parts in the value stream to minimize time lost  \nand waste.\nVideo: Take a look at our future factory.\n“ Creating a digital twin of our factory operations will help to increase \nstability and optimize performance prior to physically building a \nproduct. We have long used models to predict aircraft performance \nand refine them with test data as it comes available. Similarly, we  \nwill build models to predict production system performance and \nrefine them as systems come online.”\n  Howard McKenzie, chief engineer and executive vice president of Engineering,  \nTest & Technology\nA simulated view of what \na future commercial \nfactory could look like. \nThe concept builds off of \nlessons learned from how \nthe T-7A program operates \nin St. Louis — no fixed \ntooling, no holding fixtures. \nThe part becomes the tool, \nwhich is a revolutionary \nconcept.

Boeing strives \nto reduce operational GHG emissions, both during times of \ngrowth and during times of challenge. Our strategy for Scope \n1 and Scope 2 emissions, which we detail in the following \nsection, aligns to a 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming \npotential scenario, in support of the global climate goals. \nTo achieve our goals related to the climate and to GHG, we \nactively monitor emissions, fuel use and energy efficiency. \nWe have set 2030 targets for performance in each of these \nareas that aim to reduce absolute emissions, maintain net-\nzero emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and increase our \nadoption of renewable energy sources. As part of Boeing’s \nbusiness continuity program, we also monitor the length and \nseverity of business interruptions. The scope of monitoring \nincludes damaging weather, natural disasters, pandemics and \npublic health crises. It helps us understand how to increase \nresiliency in light of a changing climate.\nEnterprise GHG emissions from operations are calculated \nafter the conclusion of the reporting year. However, the \nemissions from natural gas and electricity usage at Core \nMetric Sites are calculated and monitored on a monthly basis \nthrough the use of utility bills and are continuously validated \nand updated throughout the reporting year. The emissions  \nfactors for these energy sources are validated at least  \nannually and updated when appropriate following guidance  \nfrom the World Resources Institute GHG Protocol. The energy  \ndata and emissions factors are verified as part of a third-party  \nlimited assurance process. \nFor the third year in a row, Boeing has achieved net-zero  \nGHG emissions at manufacturing and work sites by \nimplementing high-impact conservation investments, \nemphasizing and incentivizing conservation practices by \nemployees, and increasing renewable electricity use while \nsecuring carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for  \nthe remaining GHG emissions. \nIn 2022:\n• 2025 GHG Target Progress: Boeing had a 31% reduction \nin GHG emissions compared to 2017.

      "content": "Reducing Waste\nBoeing is making strides to protect the land, water and air in our communities \nby reducing waste from work sites and our supply chain. Waste streams are as \ncomplex as our facilities, which range from office space to part fabrication to \nassembly of aircraft and space vehicles. Solid waste includes material that has \nbeen discarded or abandoned or that is no longer useful or usable and has been \ndesignated for removal. Items that are reused or reclaimed are excluded from \nsolid waste. Boeing has dedicated teams working to prevent waste from going \nto landfills and to assess opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts. \nBoeing generates hazardous waste primarily from a variety of research, \nmanufacturing and facilities maintenance processes. Hazardous waste may \nbe recycled upstream or downstream, as on-site or off-site reclamation and \navoided generation through processes that extend useful life of consumable \nchemicals to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste \nin upstream activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous \nwaste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. \nDownstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations.  \nWe implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need  \nfor new chemicals.\nProgress Toward 2025 Hazardous and Nonhazardous  \nWaste Goals\n• Solid Waste – 40% reduction compared to 2017. The continued trend of \nincreased remote working conditions influences the overall reduction in \nsolid waste. Conservation initiatives and vendor management continue to be \nopportunities to drive further reductions. \n• Hazardous Waste – 9% reduction compared to 2017. Hazardous waste \nwas 1% higher than anticipated during the year. Benefits from implementing \nconservation initiatives were outweighed by key events across the enterprise, \nincluding a historical flood event in St. Louis, which caused an unplanned \nincrease in hazardous waste disposal from a water treatment system.\nThe Stingray gets Lean\nAs the U.S. Navy’s uncrewed aerial refueler, \nthe MQ-25 Stingray is a model of efficiency, \nin the air and on the production line.\nThe digitally engineered aircraft features \na highly efficient engine and lightweight \ncomposite skin, allowing it to stay in the \nair much longer, using little fuel itself to \ncomplete its mission.\nWithin the factory setting, robotic automation \nand advanced assembly techniques eliminate \nthe need for drilling during aircraft assembly.\nNow, the futuristic aircraft is setting new \nstandards for efficiency with a renewed  \nfocus on reducing waste through  \nLean manufacturing. \nAcross Boeing’s production system, teams \nare building momentum with Lean principles. \nThe MQ-25 is the first program within Boeing \nDefense, Space & Security to undergo a \nrenewed focus on Lean.\nA focus on the customer: “We know what Lean \nmeans to our Navy customer — operational \nexcellence, stability and execution,” Troy \nRutherford, MQ-25 vice president and program \nmanager. “When we focus on removing waste \nfrom the system and listening to those who \ndo the work, then production, innovation and \ncreativity all take a huge leap forward.

Boeing’s water is \nsourced from local public utilities (surface, ground and \nreclaimed water) and company generation (on-site well, \non-site reclamation and rain capture). This sourced water \nsupports manufacturing, sanitation, drinking water, \ncooling and irrigation across the company. The majority \nof our water is from public water supply systems, and \nmost consumption measurement is from water system \nrevenue-grade meters. Water used within our facilities is \ndischarged to public sanitary sewer systems. In some \ncases, Boeing pre-treats wastewater before discharging  \nit to public sanitary sewer systems, in compliance with \nregulatory requirements. Boeing does not set voluntary \neffluent discharge standards beyond those set  \nby regulation.\nBoeing specialists work to identify efficiencies, best \npractices and new technologies to reduce water use and \nidentify alternatives. We monitor irregularities that may \nrequire action and created a Conservation Best Practice \nprogram to minimize water use,  applying many water \nmanagement techniques endorsed by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. \nIn 2022, we achieved a 19% reduction compared to \nconsumption in 2017. Water consumption was 7% lower \nthan anticipated with sites implementing conservation \ninitiatives to increase water intake efficiencies and with \nproduction activity remaining low. Building off the \nreductions seen by 2025, Boeing will transition to an \nabsolute reduction goal to focus on the most water-\nintensive processes across the company.\n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nOperations\nQuality\nSustainable Operations\nOperational Targets  \nProgress\nAddressing Climate \nChange\nConserving Resources\nReducing Waste\nBiodiversity and  \nEnvironmental Compliance \nResponsible Supply Chain\nEnterprise Security  \nand Data Privacy \nCommunities\nReporting\n59",

Boeing \nvolunteers access photos captured in various habitats to \nidentify species and their activities. The goal is to enable \nresearch that would not be possible, or practical, \notherwise. 2021 Environment Champion, Kristin \nMarshall, has organized monthly online Zooniverse \nevents with employees.\nEngagement in 2022: In 2022, 186 employees \nvolunteered 420 hours through Zooniverse,  \nspotting and identifying animals, and generating \nthousands of dollars in gift-matching by Boeing’s  \ngift-match program.\nIt comes down to this: A wide range of animals, \nplants and microorganisms create the healthy \necosystems that all living beings depend on for \nclean air, land and water. This research results in new \ndiscoveries, data sets useful to the wider research \ncommunity and many publications.\n“ Boeing’s work with Zooniverse \nunderscores two important lessons. \nMany hands make light work and \nbiodiversity reminds us that we’re part  \nof something bigger than ourselves.”\nChris Raymond, Chief Sustainability Officer\nWildwatch Kenya tracks giraffes in Northern Kenya conservation areas, along with the other animals that share the habitat, like the \nplains zebra, to better understand the behavior, movements and population numbers of the wildlife found there. (Adobe photo)\nEnvironmental Compliance is Good  \nfor Business, People and the Planet\nA fundamental element of Boeing’s environmental policy is \nto maintain regulatory compliance. When noncompliance is \nidentified in our environmental management systems, Boeing \nevaluates and analyzes the incident, implements corrective \nactions and shares process improvements to build the \nlearning into the organization. \nBoeing paid one significant environmental penalty in 2022, \nwhere “significant” is determined by a fine greater than \n$10,000. At the end of 2021, stormwater samples collected  \nat the Santa Susana Field Lab exceeded the site-specific \npermit limits for copper, chronic toxicity, iron, manganese, \ndioxin (TCDD), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at \none or more outfalls. The penalty incurred was $22,000. \nThe site experienced high-intensity rain events in the fourth \nquarter of 2021 that resulted in higher-than-normal rates of \nerosion from the site; the excess levels are believed to be \nattributable to natural sources — such as increased erosion \nof natural soils, decaying vegetation or waterfowl waste — and \nnonindustrial sources — such as road runoff and soils adjacent \nto telephone/utility poles. Excess copper and chronic toxicity \nwere not attributed to an identifiable source and were episodic \nin nature where laboratory error was suspected.\nOn July 26, 2022, a significant rainfall event in the St. Louis \nregion caused flooding that impacted the St. Louis site \nIndustrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP). Floodwaters \novertopped the IWTP, resulting in a release of untreated \nwastewater and associated sludges, as well as approximately \n100 gallons of diesel fuel from a ruptured above-ground \nstorage tank. The release was reported to the Missouri \nDepartment of Natural Resources, the National Response \nCenter, and the St. Louis Metropolitan Sewer District, and \nappropriate response actions were completed after the \nflooding subsided. \n2023 Boeing \nSustainability Report\nContents\nIntroduction\nApproach & Governance\nPeople\nProducts & Services\nOperations\nQuality\nSustainable Operations\nOperational Targets  \nProgress\nAddressing Climate \nChange\nConserving Resources\nReducing Waste\nBiodiversity and  \nEnvironmental Compliance \nResponsible Supply Chain\nEnterprise Security  \nand Data Privacy \nCommunities\nReporting\n61",

It requires transparency about \nbusiness processes and supplied goods, \nmeeting stakeholder expectations, \naddressing regulations, and creating \npositive environmental and social impact. \nBoeing is driving a holistic approach to \nresponsible supply chain practices that \nalign with the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development’s Due \nDiligence Guidance for Responsible \nBusiness Conduct.\nIn 2021, we co-founded an industry  \neffort through the International Aerospace \nEnvironmental Group (IAEG) to establish \na voluntary sectoral framework for ESG \nengagement, including assessment and \nawareness, throughout the aerospace \nmanufacturing industry. \nEthical, responsible and sustainable \nbusiness conduct is at the core of how \nBoeing operates. These core principles \nextend to our suppliers. The Boeing \nSupplier Code of Conduct, based on the \nInternational Forum on Business Ethical \nConduct for the Aerospace and Defense \nIndustry’s model code, provides suppliers \nwith a set of responsible business conduct \nexpectations consistent with our policies, \nprinciples and sustainability efforts.  \nRead our Supplier Code of Conduct here.\nStepping up for sustainability: \nBoeing deploys supplier \nassessments \nBoeing is taking the next step to advance sustainability \nefforts by deploying an industry voluntary approach to \nsustainability assessments established by the IAEG and \nimplemented by EcoVadis. This allows Boeing to address \nsustainability considerations in procurement processes and \nmanage risk in its supply chain. \nWhy it matters: \n• Boeing has an opportunity to help influence and drive \npositive sustainability change because of the size of \nits supply chain with more than 11,000 Tier-1 suppliers \naround the globe. \n• As an IAEG founding member, Boeing played a fundamental  \nrole in the selection of EcoVadis, a sustainability rating platform, \nto power an industry sustainability assessment approach. \n• IAEG member companies participating in the sector initiative  \ncan access completed assessments to benchmark their  \nsuppliers’ sustainability performance.\n• Boeing’s engagement in this industry approach reduces the \nsupplier burden to complete multiple, unique assessment \nrequests. Suppliers also can access educational materials to  \nhelp drive sustainability improvements.\nIt comes down to this: Boeing is demonstrating its \ncommitment to responsible aerospace in a collaborative manner \nand will continue to partner with industry associations to advance \nits responsible supply chain practices and deliver innovative \nsolutions that will usher in the next era of sustainability progress.\n“ Boeing seeks to ensure that our supply chain \noperates ethically, sources responsibly and creates \neconomic opportunities for diverse communities.  \nAn industry voluntary approach is key for efficiency \nand demonstrating ESG maturity to customers, \ninvestors and regulators.”\nWilliam Ampofo, chair, Boeing Supply Chain Operations  \nCouncil, and vice president, Parts & Distribution Services  \nand Supply Chain, Boeing Global Services\nBoeing Logistics Analyst Omur Muhittinoglu develops new processes and solutions  \nto streamline the supply chain.

Add a passion for \nreducing waste, maintaining quality, preventing workplace \ninjuries and saving money, and you’ve got what motivates \nBoeing’s Transportation, Warehousing & Logistics (TWL) team.\nIn 2022, TWL team members:\n• Eliminated packaging waste by converting from single-\nuse and disposable packaging to reusable containers, \npreventing waste, which resulted in 234 metric tons \ndiverted from landfills. For example, certain 787 parts \npreviously came in a roughly built, wooden crate that took \nsix people to unload. TWL’s new reusable container is safer, \nallows faster processing and will prevent damage to parts. \nThese 787 packaging improvements will result in 161 metric \ntons of crating wood diverted from landfills annually once \nfully implemented.\n• Repurposed and refurbished containers and  \ncarts saved 26 metric tons of containers  \nand packaging materials.\n• Prevented 18,500 cardboard boxes from being shipped to \nPuget Sound factories, saving time and eliminating material \nwaste. Consolidation centers continue to enable the use \nof generic reusable containers, such as shipping reusable \ncontainers through Southern California.\n• Boeing also began using cross-docking — a logistics \nprocedure where products from a supplier or manufacturing \nplant are distributed directly to a customer with marginal to \nno handling or storage time. Cross-dock benefits include \nreduced transportation costs, fewer lost or damaged \nparts, and predictable pickup and delivery schedules. As a \nresult, 145 suppliers and Boeing sites across Commercial, \nServices and Defense businesses reduced transportation \ncosts, standardized pickups and optimized transportation \nroutes using cross-docks.\n• Reduced GHG emissions — Regional truck pickups \nconsolidated shipments at the sorting center to better use \nlong-haul trucks while reducing less-than-full shipments \nand transit time, which reduces GHG emissions.  \nWhat’s next: The team continues to optimize the Boeing \nlogistics network by analyzing shipment volume, truck \nutilization, supplier distance from cross-docks, identifying \nconsolidation opportunities and route changes on shipments \nfrom overseas suppliers.\nBoeing partners with service provider Universal Logistics at their \ncross-docking facilities in Renton, Washington; Compton, California; \nand Charleston, South Carolina, to provide the most efficient \npickup and delivery of parts to enable manufacturing and assembly \nof aircraft.

Boeing contributed $5 million in support of \nenvironmental programs in 2022.\nAmericas\n• U.S.: Boeing supports the National Forest Foundation’s \nProject Green Drone, an educational program dedicated to \nstrengthening the STEM pipeline in the Phoenix area. \nTogether with the Ecoculture Team at Northern Arizona \nUniversity and other local partners, the National Forest \nFoundation engages more than 500 local middle and high \nschool students in STEM-focused activities to address \nreal-world environmental projects, including a watershed \nrestoration project on the Lower Salt River. The project is \ndiversifying the pipeline for conservation talent while \nworking on protecting fresh water supplies and using \ninnovative technology to preserve public lands. \n• Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, \nMexico and Panama: Boeing is supporting the Pan \nAmerican Development Foundation (PADF) that is active in \neight countries, working with teachers, and primary and \nuniversity or post-university students to find solutions to \nlocal environmental issues. For example, in Bolivia, PADF \nworks with partners to develop a curriculum about \nalternative energy, waste management, natural resources \nand identifying local solutions. In Ecuador and Mexico, local \npartners will work with teachers to design lessons that \naddress local needs such as reducing pollution, using \nplastic alternatives or storing electricity.\nAsia\n• Korea: Boeing supports the Climate Science Class \nprogram, which is part of Korea Green Foundation, \nbenefiting 550 young leaders. The goal of the program is to \nfoster next-generation green leaders who will solve climate \nchange problems, including biodiversity loss and forest \ndestruction. It also examines human influence and regional \nenvironmental issues and technology solutions. Climate \nchange, in particular, is a broad and complex phenomenon \nand is a suitable subject for implementing the purpose of \nmodeling-based learning, which constitutes an explanatory \nframework based on a variety of data.\nEurope\n• Italy: “School Cleaning Day” is an environmental education \nprogram — organized by ScuolAttiva Onlus with support \nfrom Boeing — that works to encourage Italian students and \nteachers to adopt ecological models of behavior and \nawareness of sustainable development and environmental \nprotection.

Students cared for \nand maintained these rain gardens as part of the program.\nGo deeper: A 2021 grant from Boeing \nhelped EarthGen expand the Stormwater \nStewards program into two additional Puget \nSound school districts, which worked to \nadd sustainable treatment for approximately \n625,000 gallons of water.\nMiddle school students plant in their rain garden \nin the Seattle suburb of Burien.

As cyber threats \nincrease in volume and sophistication, the risk to the security of these systems and networks — and to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of \nthe data they house — continues to evolve, requiring constant vigilance and concerted, companywide risk management efforts. Boeing takes a \nrisk-based approach to managing the security of its data and has a documented low-risk appetite for cybersecurity and data protection, while \nrecognizing that business requirements may necessitate adjustments to that risk tolerance. To address these risks, we maintain an extensive network \nof technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight. We also have established a Security \nCouncil to strengthen governance and coordination of cyber and physical security activities. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect \nand respond to unauthorized activity, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of a cyberattack or data loss or \nthe potentially serious reputational, operational or financial impacts that may result. A strong partnership exists between IT, Enterprise Security, \nCorporate Audit, and Legal to ensure identified issues are addressed in a timely manner and incidents are reported to the appropriate regulatory \nbodies as required.\nDescription of approach to identifying and  \naddressing data security risks in products\nRT-AE-230a.2\nProduct Security Engineering provides a disciplined approach to the development and sustainment of our products, which is essential to ensuring \nmission assurance, resiliency and security. Security is integrated into our engineering processes, starting from concept development, ensuring  \nthat we develop products that are secure by design. Key cyber attributes and adversity (or threat) to the system are identified during requirements  \nengineering, allocated throughout design, implemented and validated during development, fully tested and supported during sustainment. Additionally, \nBoeing works to ensure that our products are designed to anticipate, withstand, recover and adapt to cyberattack. Specifically, our security processes \nensure that we have high-level requirements to baseline and monitor data flow and system behavior, detect anomalies and actively manage system \nconfiguration. The ability of our systems to understand normal operations and rapidly detect and mitigate the abnormal, combined with the security \nengineering focus of our development processes, provides Boeing’s programs with a proactive approach to risk management. Product Security is also \nintegrated into the Boeing enterprise Incident Response process, and we work seamless with stakeholders to rapidly identify, analyze, and mitigate \nvulnerabilities and breaches across our portfolio.\n1.
