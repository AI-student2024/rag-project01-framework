  "response": "GRPO is a method in reinforcement learning that optimizes the policy while avoiding the need for a full-fledged critic model. It estimates the baseline by sampling group scores instead of using the traditional approach. For each question 𝑞, GRPO selects a group of outputs from the policy and optimizes the policy based on these group scores.\n\n</回答>",

Specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:",
