  "response": "根据上下文提供的信息，GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）是一种在强化学习（RL）中用于减少训练成本的策略。它通过放弃通常与政策模型大小相同的 critic模型，而非直接估计基于群体评分的基准。具体来说，对于每一个问题 𝑞，GRPO 随机选取了一个群体输出 {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺}，然后优化政策模型 𝜋𝜃，以最大化以下目标函数。",

      "text": "Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:",
