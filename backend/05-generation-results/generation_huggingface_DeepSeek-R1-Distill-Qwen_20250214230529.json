  "response": "GRPO is a reinforcement learning technique that optimizes the policy by estimating the baseline based on group scores. It avoids the need for a large critic model and reduces training costs compared to traditional policy gradient methods. The approach samples multiple policy outputs from the old policy and uses their scores to compute an estimate of the baseline, which is then used to maximize the objective function for the new policy. This method is particularly useful in scenarios with large action spaces or when computational resources are limited.</回答>",

      "text": "Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question 𝑞, GRPO samples a group of outputs {𝑜1, 𝑜2, · · · , 𝑜𝐺} from the old policy 𝜋𝜃𝑜𝑙𝑑 and then optimizes the policy model 𝜋𝜃 by maximizing the following objective:",
