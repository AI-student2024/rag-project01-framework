CDP Water Report
Key to Boeing’s water stewardship efforts is our internal Conservation Best Practices 
program that engages all employees from the shop floor to our C-suite. Conservation Best 
Practices are low-cost, proven initiatives that reduce resource use by Boeing operations.  
In 2022, Boeing focused water reduction efforts on improving process efficiencies across  
the company.
We utilize monthly metrics to identify irregularities that may indicate an impact on water 
consumption that requires action, as well as the Conservation Best Practice (CBP) program 
to minimize on-site water use. Boeing utilizes many of the water management techniques 
endorsed by the U.S. EPA in this CBP program, which include: Meter/Measure/Manage; 
Optimize Cooling towers; Replace Restroom Fixtures; Eliminate Single Pass Cooling; Use 
Water-Smart Landscaping and Irrigation.
Boeing regularly reviews industry best practices and utilizes ISO 14001 to target continuous 
improvement opportunities, enhance environmental performance, meet its compliance 
obligations and achieve its reduction goals.

We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most 
important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings 
and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of 
the sources could take a year or more. During 2022, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, we suspended purchasing titanium from Russia. This has 
not disrupted our operations as we have been able to use inventory on hand and identify alternative sources. Many major components and product 
equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis. We continue to work with a small number of sole-source suppliers to ensure 
continuity of supply for certain items.

1.  Operational goals shown are absolute targets and not indexed to production levels or growth. 2022 performance was affected by changes associated with occupancy and operations during the COVID-19 
pandemic, as well as conservation and changes in how Boeing purchases energy. The targets were established against a 2017 base year. The 2025 goals will act as a milestone to guide actions and  
progress to the 2030 goals.
2.  All 2025 reduction goals were set with an operational boundary of the Core Metric Sites, which represent the majority (70%) of Boeing’s operations, and includes emissions from electricity use and natural gas.
3.  The 2030 reduction goals set with an operational boundary of The Boeing Company and includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
4.  The net-zero achievement covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for all manufacturing and work sites within the company’s operational control as well as Scope 3, business travel. This is achieved  
by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
5. Energy includes natural gas, other fuels and electricity.
6. Water data represents approximately 84% of operations square footage.
7.  Solid waste numbers represent values determined from scale-weighed containers as well as calculated weights. Nonhazardous solid waste is sent to landfill for disposal. This measure applies to all waste 
streams where Boeing is responsible for waste disposal service as a normal part of daily operations (excludes remediation and construction-related waste).
8.  Hazardous waste is determined from U.S. EPA hazardous manifest or equivalent government shipping documents. All types of hazardous wastes that are generated at a facility and are discarded from  
the site for disposal, and would be considered part of the environmental footprint of the site. Actual tons of all Production or routine wastes shipped as hazardous waste (excludes remediation and 
construction-related waste).

83",32,0.43265530467033386,"Parts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from  
the movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional 
hubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can 
lessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 
for more information.
Supplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral 
framework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. 
Used Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material. 
Build/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other 
work sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product. Boeing cuts waste to landfill, water, energy and hazardous chemicals.  
Read more about how we do so on Page 52. For example, when testing aircraft, Boeing uses blended sustainable aviation fuels. 
Sustainable Operations: Since 2020, Boeing has maintained workplace net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1  
and Scope 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected,  
third-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.
ecoDemonstrator: To accelerate innovation for current and future airplane sustainability, our 10-year-old ecoDemonstrator flying test bed program takes 
promising technologies out of a lab and tests them in an operational environment.
Use. Boeing provides solutions for customers to lower their carbon footprints while they are using our aircraft. For example, armed with real-time data, flight 
crews can make adjustments to optimize fuel use, and thus minimize the carbon footprint of each flight. Digital tools empower our airline customers to conserve 
fuel, track emissions and enhance their operations’ overall efficiency, while defense customers can conserve fuel and lower emissions with platform-agnostic 
digital systems with maintenance, supply chain and flight planning recommendations based on analytics.
Government Services: As our tools ingest flight, maintenance and supply data, our analytics produce results that drive efficiency across the system. 
Read more on Page 37.
End of Service. Up to 90 percent of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries. We manage 
and recertify used parts for aircraft, and engine platforms for our customers. 
Remanufactured: Boeing remanufactures aircraft, such as the 115 AH-64D Apache for government customers, which includes upgrading configurations with the 
latest technology and keeping valuable materials in a closed loop. 
Boeing Converted Freighter Fleet Renewal: Boeing’s passenger-to-freighter programs provide airlines an economical way to replace less efficient,  
older-generation freighters with more efficient freighters created from repurposed passenger aircraft.

Boeing is making strides to protect the land, water and air in our communities 
by reducing waste from work sites and our supply chain. Waste streams are as 
complex as our facilities, which range from office space to part fabrication to 
assembly of aircraft and space vehicles. Solid waste includes material that has 
been discarded or abandoned or that is no longer useful or usable and has been 
designated for removal. Items that are reused or reclaimed are excluded from 
solid waste. Boeing has dedicated teams working to prevent waste from going 
to landfills and to assess opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts. 
Boeing generates hazardous waste primarily from a variety of research, 
manufacturing and facilities maintenance processes. Hazardous waste may 
be recycled upstream or downstream, as on-site or off-site reclamation and 
avoided generation through processes that extend useful life of consumable 
chemicals to avoid hazardous waste. We look to reduce hazardous waste 
in upstream activities by preventing or reducing the amount of hazardous 
waste generated through extending system life through contaminant removal. 
Downstream, we look at hazardous waste generated from site operations.  
We implement several recycling and recovery activities to reduce the need  
for new chemicals.
Progress Toward 2025 Hazardous and Nonhazardous  
Waste Goals
• Solid Waste – 40% reduction compared to 2017. The continued trend of 
increased remote working conditions influences the overall reduction in 
solid waste. Conservation initiatives and vendor management continue to be 
opportunities to drive further reductions. 
• Hazardous Waste – 9% reduction compared to 2017. Hazardous waste 
was 1% higher than anticipated during the year. Benefits from implementing 
conservation initiatives were outweighed by key events across the enterprise, 
including a historical flood event in St. Louis, which caused an unplanned 
increase in hazardous waste disposal from a water treatment system.
The Stingray gets Lean
As the U.S. Navy’s uncrewed aerial refueler, 
the MQ-25 Stingray is a model of efficiency, 
in the air and on the production line.
The digitally engineered aircraft features 
a highly efficient engine and lightweight 
composite skin, allowing it to stay in the 
air much longer, using little fuel itself to 
complete its mission.
Within the factory setting, robotic automation 
and advanced assembly techniques eliminate 
the need for drilling during aircraft assembly.
Now, the futuristic aircraft is setting new 
standards for efficiency with a renewed  
focus on reducing waste through  
Lean manufacturing. 
Across Boeing’s production system, teams 
are building momentum with Lean principles. 
The MQ-25 is the first program within Boeing 
Defense, Space & Security to undergo a 
renewed focus on Lean.
A focus on the customer: “We know what Lean 
means to our Navy customer — operational 
excellence, stability and execution,” Troy 
Rutherford, MQ-25 vice president and program 
manager. “When we focus on removing waste 
from the system and listening to those who 
do the work, then production, innovation and 
creativity all take a huge leap forward. We’re 
excited to be the first program to engage with 
the Lean workshops.”
What is Lean? Lean is a way of thinking 
and acting that enables us to solve problems 
and continually improve. It is the foundation 
of Boeing’s production system and embraces 
just-in-time delivery, error-free production  
and continuous flow. Lean helps spot and 
eliminate waste, wherever it is found, which 
also reduces costs.

86",32,0.4151745140552521,"Parts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from  
the movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional 
hubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can 
lessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 
for more information.
Supplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral 
framework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. 
Used Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material. 
Build/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other 
work sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product. Boeing cuts waste to landfill, water, energy and hazardous chemicals.  
Read more about how we do so on Page 52. For example, when testing aircraft, Boeing uses blended sustainable aviation fuels. 
Sustainable Operations: Since 2020, Boeing has maintained workplace net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1  
and Scope 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected,  
third-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.
ecoDemonstrator: To accelerate innovation for current and future airplane sustainability, our 10-year-old ecoDemonstrator flying test bed program takes 
promising technologies out of a lab and tests them in an operational environment.
Use. Boeing provides solutions for customers to lower their carbon footprints while they are using our aircraft. For example, armed with real-time data, flight 
crews can make adjustments to optimize fuel use, and thus minimize the carbon footprint of each flight. Digital tools empower our airline customers to conserve 
fuel, track emissions and enhance their operations’ overall efficiency, while defense customers can conserve fuel and lower emissions with platform-agnostic 
digital systems with maintenance, supply chain and flight planning recommendations based on analytics.
Government Services: As our tools ingest flight, maintenance and supply data, our analytics produce results that drive efficiency across the system. 
Read more on Page 37.
End of Service. Up to 90 percent of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries. We manage 
and recertify used parts for aircraft, and engine platforms for our customers. 
Remanufactured: Boeing remanufactures aircraft, such as the 115 AH-64D Apache for government customers, which includes upgrading configurations with the 
latest technology and keeping valuable materials in a closed loop. 
Boeing Converted Freighter Fleet Renewal: Boeing’s passenger-to-freighter programs provide airlines an economical way to replace less efficient,  
older-generation freighters with more efficient freighters created from repurposed passenger aircraft.

Boeing appreciates sustainable aerospace starts inside our 
four walls. We are focused on continuous improvements 
in pursuit of the sustainable product life cycle across key 
elements including greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2), energy usage, water and waste management. 
We take action to decrease our impact through renewable 
energy procurement, targeted infrastructure and equipment 
investments, efficiency standards and conservation initiatives 
that include deployment of best practices and employee 
engagement strategies. Core to this strategy is the ongoing 
engagement of our employees each year through education 
and initiatives focused on ways in which they can reduce 
their environmental impact at work, and at home. Boeing’s 
environmental strategy is guided by a comprehensive review 
and assessment of the most significant environmental 
challenges and risks facing the company, and our 
environmental priorities are set with internal and external 
stakeholders. The analysis includes direct input and 
perspectives on industry best practices and community 
requirements from diverse stakeholders, such as customers, 
environment-focused nongovernmental organizations (NGO) 
and the company’s global leadership. The information helps 
Boeing identify and update our understanding of current and 
emerging sustainability issues that are critical to the company 
and our stakeholders. It also informs our next-generation 
environmental strategy and targets. 
Since 2020, Boeing has achieved net-zero GHG emissions 
at manufacturing and work sites by expanding conservation 
and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected, 
third-party-verified offsets for the remaining greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions.

52",32,0.44282764196395874,"Parts. Boeing aims to reduce carbon emissions and waste from parts, components and systems procured from suppliers. We reduce carbon emissions from  
the movement of millions of airplane spare parts by consolidating shipments, eliminating single-use packaging and redesigning warehousing networks to regional 
hubs. In addition, we use additive manufacturing to 3D print some of our own parts. Doing so allows us to change the designs of some parts in a way that can 
lessen their environmental impact by creating lighter consolidated parts that use less raw material, fewer machining processes and leave less waste. See Page 64 
for more information.
Supplier Collaboration: In 2021, Boeing co-founded an industry effort through the International Aerospace Environmental Group to establish a voluntary sectoral 
framework for ESG engagement, including assessment and awareness, throughout the aerospace manufacturing industry. 
Used Serviceable Material Offerings: Boeing Service business provides access to recertified used parts from retired aircraft called used serviceable material. 
Build/Test. Reducing waste from operations while boosting the use of renewable energy and digital technologies can help our manufacturing and other 
work sites reduce their environmental impact while building and testing a product. Boeing cuts waste to landfill, water, energy and hazardous chemicals.  
Read more about how we do so on Page 52. For example, when testing aircraft, Boeing uses blended sustainable aviation fuels. 
Sustainable Operations: Since 2020, Boeing has maintained workplace net-zero GHG emissions at manufacturing sites and other facilities (Scope 1  
and Scope 2) and in its business travel (Scope 3, Category 6) by expanding conservation and renewable energy use while securing carefully selected,  
third-party-verified offsets for the remaining GHG emissions.
ecoDemonstrator: To accelerate innovation for current and future airplane sustainability, our 10-year-old ecoDemonstrator flying test bed program takes 
promising technologies out of a lab and tests them in an operational environment.
Use. Boeing provides solutions for customers to lower their carbon footprints while they are using our aircraft. For example, armed with real-time data, flight 
crews can make adjustments to optimize fuel use, and thus minimize the carbon footprint of each flight. Digital tools empower our airline customers to conserve 
fuel, track emissions and enhance their operations’ overall efficiency, while defense customers can conserve fuel and lower emissions with platform-agnostic 
digital systems with maintenance, supply chain and flight planning recommendations based on analytics.
Government Services: As our tools ingest flight, maintenance and supply data, our analytics produce results that drive efficiency across the system. 
Read more on Page 37.
End of Service. Up to 90 percent of the parts and materials in Boeing aircraft can be reused and recycled across aerospace and other industries. We manage 
and recertify used parts for aircraft, and engine platforms for our customers. 
Remanufactured: Boeing remanufactures aircraft, such as the 115 AH-64D Apache for government customers, which includes upgrading configurations with the 
latest technology and keeping valuable materials in a closed loop. 
Boeing Converted Freighter Fleet Renewal: Boeing’s passenger-to-freighter programs provide airlines an economical way to replace less efficient,  
older-generation freighters with more efficient freighters created from repurposed passenger aircraft.

Key to Boeing’s water stewardship efforts is our internal Conservation Best Practices 
program that engages all employees from the shop floor to our C-suite. Conservation Best 
Practices are low-cost, proven initiatives that reduce resource use by Boeing operations.  
In 2022, Boeing focused water reduction efforts on improving process efficiencies across  
the company.
We utilize monthly metrics to identify irregularities that may indicate an impact on water 
consumption that requires action, as well as the Conservation Best Practice (CBP) program 
to minimize on-site water use. Boeing utilizes many of the water management techniques 
endorsed by the U.S. EPA in this CBP program, which include: Meter/Measure/Manage; 
Optimize Cooling towers; Replace Restroom Fixtures; Eliminate Single Pass Cooling; Use 
Water-Smart Landscaping and Irrigation.
Boeing regularly reviews industry best practices and utilizes ISO 14001 to target continuous 
improvement opportunities, enhance environmental performance, meet its compliance 
obligations and achieve its reduction goals.

Airplane and Carbon Fiber Recycling Fact Sheet
Boeing has dedicated internal teams to prevent waste from going to the landfill. Our 
reclamation team works to capture and collect materials across the company, while our 
investment recovery team repurposes materials, facilitates donations and sells scrap 
materials. Our packaging team assesses opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts 
and materials. Packaging engineers have developed standards for reusing containers with 
our suppliers. Our employees also develop processes to reuse and repurpose incoming 
packing materials, helping to reduce waste and cost. The Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, 
based on the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct for the Aerospace and 
Defense Industry’s model code, provides suppliers with a set of responsible business 
conduct expectations consistent with our policies, principles and ESG efforts.

Airplane and Carbon Fiber Recycling Fact Sheet
Boeing has dedicated internal teams to prevent waste from going to the landfill. Our 
reclamation team works to capture and collect materials across the company, while our 
investment recovery team repurposes materials, facilitates donations and sells scrap 
materials. Our packaging team assesses opportunities to return or reuse packaging for parts 
and materials. Packaging engineers have developed standards for reusing containers with 
our suppliers. Our employees also develop processes to reuse and repurpose incoming 
packing materials, helping to reduce waste and cost. The Boeing Supplier Code of Conduct, 
based on the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct for the Aerospace and 
Defense Industry’s model code, provides suppliers with a set of responsible business 
conduct expectations consistent with our policies, principles and ESG efforts.
